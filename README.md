Module2

## Project Overview
Co-worker Tom provided the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received. 
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won. 
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code, 1.73.0

## Summary
The analysis of the election shows that:
- There were 369,711 total votes cast in the election
- The candidates were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham
  - Diana DeGette
  - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The candidate results were:
  - Chales Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 votes
  - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 votes

- The Winner of the election was:
  - Diana DeGette who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 votes
  
## Challenge Overview
The challenge was conducted using Python in the Visual Studio Code. The main functions used to complete the analysis were `for` loops with nested `if` statements. The `csv` dependancy was also used to read and write csv and txt files. 

## Challenge Summary
Using the `csv` dependancy can be very useful for analyzing large sets of data and sumarizing data on a separate file that can be shared with stakeholders. Utilizing Python for this challenge allowed for a quick analysis of the data with minimal amount of code.
